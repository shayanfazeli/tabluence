# Tabluence: Tabular Time-series Machine Learning Framework

## Introduction
Tabluence is a machine learning framework focused on the intersection of two critical domains in the machine
learning world: sequential data and tabular domain.

__Remark__: This repository contains the code for our manuscript: "Passive Monitoring of Physiological Precursors of Stress by Leveraging Smartwatch Data"

__Remark__: This repository is a work in progress.
